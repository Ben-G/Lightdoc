#Create a new project

This section will explain how to create a new Cocos2D project. Cocos2D 3.x provides two different options to create a project:

- **Create a project with SpriteBuilder**: If you create a new project within SpriteBuilder, SpriteBuilder will setup a correspoding Xcode project for you. 
- **Create a project in Xcode**: If you create a new project in Xcode it will not use SpriteBuilder by default.

For most games we recommend creating the project with SpriteBuilder. Even if a developer does not want to use SpriteBuilder to create the actual gameplay, it is very useful to create user interfaces that are needed in almost every game.

This guide will describe both options, starting with creating a new project in SpriteBuilder.
